<!--
Add more phases and tasks as needed. Adjust the number to match actual work required.

IMPORTANT: Keep each task small and specific. Break down large tasks into smaller, concrete, actionable steps.
- Good: "Read config file and extract database settings"
- Bad: "Set up entire database connection system"

Each task should be completable in a reasonable time and have clear completion criteria.
