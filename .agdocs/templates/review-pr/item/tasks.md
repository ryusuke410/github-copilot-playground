<!-- 
Add more tasks based on PR complexity and review focus.

IMPORTANT: Keep each task small and specific. Break down review by files.

**File Review Granularity:**
- **Split file reviews**: Create at least 1 task per file (ideally more for large files)
- **Aim for: Number of files < Number of tasks**
- Example for 5-file PR: Create 7-10 tasks
  - Task 4.1: Review src/auth/login.ts
  - Task 4.2: Review src/auth/signup.ts  
  - Task 4.3: Review tests/auth.test.ts
  - Task 4.4: Review related files (middleware, config)
  - Task 4.5: Check integration between auth modules

Good task breakdown:
- "Review authentication logic in src/auth/login.ts"
- "Review test coverage for login function"
- "Check error handling in signup flow"

Bad task breakdown:
- "Review all authentication changes" (too broad)
- "Review entire codebase" (way too broad)
