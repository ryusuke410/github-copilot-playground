# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to begin working on this simple task:

### 1. Understand the Context

Read the following documents in order:
1. [Human Instructions](./human-instructions.md) - Understand what was requested

### 2. Review Current State

- Check the [Tasks](./tasks.md) document to see what's been completed and what's next

### 3. Reorganize Tasks as Needed

1. Edit [tasks.md](./tasks.md) to reorder tasks based on priority or dependencies

### 4. Start Working

1. Pick the next task from the task list
2. Read the task details and acceptance criteria
3. Begin implementation
4. **After completing each task, read `.agdocs/commands/yeah.md` to maintain workflow context**
5. Update the task status as you progress

### 5. Handle Task Modifications

**If human requests task additions or modifications:**
1. **First, update [human-instructions.md](./human-instructions.md)** with the new requirements
2. Then, reorganize and update [tasks.md](./tasks.md) accordingly
3. Continue with the updated task list

This ensures the human's intent is documented before task restructuring.
