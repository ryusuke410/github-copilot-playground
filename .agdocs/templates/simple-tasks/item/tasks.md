IMPORTANT TEMPLATE RULES:

1. Task Format: Each task MUST follow this format:
   - [ ] Task X.X - [Task title]
     - Details: [Detailed description of what needs to be done]
     - Completion criteria: [How to know when this task is done]

2. Task Numbering: Use hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.) to organize related tasks

3. Task Details: Always include:
   - Details: Specific actions, files to modify, considerations
   - Completion criteria: Clear, measurable outcomes

4. Final Verification Task: The LAST task must always be a verification task to ensure nothing is missed

5. Task Granularity: 
   - Keep each task small and specific
   - Break down large tasks into smaller, concrete, actionable steps
   - Good: "Read config file and extract database settings"
   - Bad: "Set up entire database connection system"

6. Number of Tasks: Use as many or as few tasks as needed - there's no fixed count

Example of a well-formed task:
- [ ] Task 2.1 - Update README installation section
  - Details: Add steps for installing new dependencies (redis, postgresql). Include version requirements and configuration examples.
  - Completion criteria: Installation section includes all new dependencies with clear steps and version info
