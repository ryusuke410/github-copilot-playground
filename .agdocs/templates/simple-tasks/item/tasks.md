<!-- 
Add more tasks as needed. The number of tasks should match the actual work required - it can be any number, not fixed to a specific count.

IMPORTANT: Keep each task small and specific. Break down large tasks into smaller, concrete, actionable steps.
- Good: "Read config file and extract database settings"
- Bad: "Set up entire database connection system"

Each task should be completable in a reasonable time and have clear completion criteria.
