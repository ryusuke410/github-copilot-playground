# GitHub Copilot Playground

A repository for experimenting with AI-assisted development workflows using GitHub Copilot, structured documentation systems, and the AGDocs framework.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Development Workflows

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for building AI-assisted development workflows:

- **Structured Command System**: Pre-defined workflows for common development tasks
- **Memory Bank System**: Project knowledge management with markdown files
- **Custom GitHub Copilot Prompts**: Entry points for AI agent workflows
- **Dev-Log System**: Task management and progress tracking

### ðŸ“¦ AGDocs Scaffolding

Install the `.agdocs` directory structure into new projects:

```bash
./scripts/agdocs-scaffolding.sh /path/to/new-project
```

The scaffolding script copies:
- Command definitions for AI workflows
- Memory bank documentation templates
- Helper scripts and tools
- GitHub Copilot prompts

### ðŸ”„ `/yeah` Command

The `/yeah` command is a critical component for continuous AI agent operation. It ensures the AI agent:
- Never ends the conversation prematurely
- Maintains workflow context across operations
- Follows structured task management
- Reloads critical instructions automatically

**Usage:**
1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Type `/yeah` 
3. Follow with your task description or instructions

The `/yeah` command loads `.agdocs/commands/yeah.md`, which contains the core rules for AI agent behavior.

### ðŸŒŸ `awake` Prompt

The `awake` prompt is a standalone version of the `/yeah` command, designed for continuous AI agent operation without requiring the full command file setup.

**Key Features:**
- **Continuous Operation**: Keeps the AI agent active and working without ending the conversation
- **Task Management**: Uses the todo tool to track progress across multi-step work
- **Context Preservation**: Automatically reloads critical instructions when the context window is compressed
- **Interactive Queries**: Prompts the user for input when clarification is needed or tasks are complete

**Usage:**
1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Attach `awake.prompt.md` to your chat
3. Provide your task instructions

**When to Use:**
- Long-running tasks that require multiple steps
- Situations where you want the AI agent to manage its own workflow
- When you need continuous interaction without manual intervention

The `awake` prompt is particularly useful for:
- Complex refactoring tasks
- Multi-file updates
- Documentation generation
- Systematic code reviews

Unlike `/yeah`, which references a command file, `awake` contains complete instructions within the prompt file itself, making it self-contained and easy to use in any context.

## The `.agdocs` Directory

The `.agdocs` directory is the heart of this AI-assisted development system:

```
.agdocs/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/              # AI agent workflow definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ yeah.md           # Core AI agent rules

â””â”€â”€ templates/             # Reusable templates
    â”œâ”€â”€ dev-logs/
    â””â”€â”€ memory/
```

### Key Components

- **Commands**: Structured instructions for AI workflows (e.g., creating branches, reviewing PRs, committing code)
- **Memory Banks**: Project knowledge repository in markdown format
- **Prompts**: GitHub Copilot entry points that reference command files
- **Scripts**: Interactive helpers for user input collection
- **Dev-Logs**: Task management system for complex work

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- GitHub Copilot subscription
- VS Code (recommended)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryusuke410/github-copilot-playground.git
   cd github-copilot-playground
   ```

2. **Use the `/yeah` command:**
   - Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code
   - Type `/yeah` followed by your task
   - Example: `/yeah create a new development branch`

3. **Scaffold into a new project:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/agdocs-scaffolding.sh /path/to/your-project
   ```

## Available Commands

The `.agdocs/commands/` directory contains pre-defined workflows:

- **`yeah.md`**: Core AI agent behavior and rules
- **`commit-push-pr.md`**: Automated git commit, push, and PR creation
- **`review-pr.md`**: Systematic PR review workflow
- **`create-dev-branch.md`**: Development branch creation from main
- **`add-command.md`**: Create new command files
- **`dev-log.md`**: Task management with dev-logs
- **`initialize-memory-bank.md`**: Memory bank initialization
- **`update-memory-bank-targeted.md`**: Targeted memory bank updates
- **`update-memory-bank-comprehensive.md`**: Comprehensive memory bank updates

## GitHub Copilot Prompts

The `.github/prompts/` directory contains custom prompts for GitHub Copilot:

- **`awake.prompt.md`**: Standalone prompt for continuous AI agent operation
- **`yeah.prompt.md`**: Entry point for the yeah command workflow
- **`commit-push-pr.prompt.md`**: Entry point for commit, push, and PR workflow
- **`create-dev-branch.prompt.md`**: Entry point for branch creation workflow
- **`dev-log.prompt.md`**: Entry point for dev-log task management
- **`review-pr.prompt.md`**: Entry point for PR review workflow

Most prompts reference their corresponding command files in `.agdocs/commands/`, except `awake.prompt.md` which is self-contained.

## Memory Bank System

Memory banks store project knowledge in a structured, AI-readable format:

- **Project Overview**: Purpose, stakeholders, architecture
- **Coding Guidelines**: Style guides, naming conventions, best practices
- **Codebase Structure**: Directory organization, module structure
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Domain terminology
- **GitHub Operations**: API usage patterns and workflows

Memory banks enable the AI agent to understand your project deeply and provide contextually appropriate suggestions.
